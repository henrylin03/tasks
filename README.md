## Usage

Once **[Tasks](https://henrylin.io/tasks)** loads, you should see a list of tasks in your inbox or, if it's your first time, a blank inbox.

Your inbox stores once-off tasks, and any tasks you haven't categorised yet into a "project". A project is a collection of tasks that all try and achieve the same goal. For example, you might have a project called "Japan trip" and lists out all the tasks you need to do before you holiday there. You can see all of your projects to the left.

You can expand any tasks by clicking on it. In the popup, you can also edit any of the details as things evolve.

</div>

Once a task is done, you can tick the checkbox, and the tasks will go to the bottom of your inbox or project.
